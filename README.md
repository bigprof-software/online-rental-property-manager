![](https://cdn.bigprof.com/appgini-open-source-apps/orpm-properties-detail-view-showing-child-table-units-thumb.png)

Online rental property manager (ORPM) allows you to manage your rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview. ORPM was created using 
[AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/). So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device.
