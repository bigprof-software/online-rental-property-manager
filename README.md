<img src="https://cdn.bigprof.com/screencasts/online-rental-property-manager-demo-6.3.gif" title="ORPM screencast" alt="ORPM (Online rental property manager) screencast" width="960" height="465" style="width: 100%; max-width: 960px; height: auto;">

Online rental property manager (ORPM) is a free open source app.
It allows you to manage landlords, rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview.

ORPM was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/).
So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive, multi-user web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device.

## Installation

> <img src="https://cdn.bigprof.com/images/online-meeting.png" style="width: 50px; float: right; margin-left: 10px" alt="Book a support call"> **Need assistance?** [Book a Google Meet session](https://bigprof.com/appgini/consulting-service) with us for a live walkthrough of the installation process, plus any requests for customization or additional features.

This is a PHP/MySQL web application that you run from a browser. You can install it either locally
on your own PC, or to a web/intranet server.

### 1. Try the live demo

* We provide a live demo with sample data [here](https://demos.appgini.com/online-rental-property-manager/)
* You can access the demo as a guest user, with read-only access to data.
* You can also access the demo using the following credentials:
  * Username: `demo`
  * Password: `demo`

  The above credentials allow browsing the sample data with read-only access,
  as well as adding new data, with full access (view, edit, delete). Data added
  through the demo account is automatically removed periodically to prevent
  cluttering the demo app.

### 2. Trying it out using Gitpod (requires a github account)

This application is ready to run within the Gitpod IDE.
This will allow you to try the application out and develop it for your needs.
All you will need is a web browser. _Do not use this in production!!!_

**[Launch private demo on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-rental-property-manager)**

The app would take a couple of minutes to launch.
Afterwards, you'll see the welcome screen of the app in the right part of the window, where you can start the setup wizard.
When prompted to enter the database name, database username and datatbase password, you should enter `appgini` for all.

Gitpod is intended for previewing the app only, and is _not suitable for use in actual production environments_.

## Customization

This application was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini). This means you can easily customize it by
opening the included AXP project file in AppGini. Examples of possible customization you can do from there include:

* [Changing the application theme](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/how-to-easily-change-your-appgini-application-theme).
* Adding more fields to existing tables, or entirely new tables to fit your use cases.
* Changing the options/behavior of any table/field in your application.
* For more details, check [the AppGini tutorials](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/).

You can also perform more advanced customization, like adding reports,
changing validation rules, adding business logic, ... etc. through hooks.
Please refer to the [AppGini hooks documentation](https://bigprof.com/appgini/help/advanced-topics/hooks)
for more details.
