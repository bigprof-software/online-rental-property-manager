/*

If you'd like to translate your AppGini app, this is
the right file to change! However, please check this page
first as you might found an already existing translation
that you can update instead of starting from scratch:

https://bigprof.com/appgini/download-language-files

IMPORTANT:
==========
When translating, only translate the strings that are
TO THE RIGHT OF the arrow sign (=>).

Do NOT translate the strings between square brackets ([])
Also, leave the text between < and > untranslated.
And also, leave the special string %s as-is, untranslated.

=====================================================
PLEASE NOTE:
============
When a new version of AppGini is released, new strings
might be added to the "defaultLang.php" file. To translate
them, simply copy them to this file ("language.php") and 
translate them here. Do NOT translate them directly in 
the "defaultLang.php" file.
=====================================================

To avoid any error messages, please make sure to:

1. Add a comma at the end of each line if it's not already there.
2. Leave the last line in this file like this:
];
